I see this project to be a chatbot that every Tunisia Family uses to plan for their next car.
Today it is super hard for a non tech savy to plan the next car to get since the laws are changing and we have so many
rules and restrictions in Tunisia, but recently a Law (FCR) was granted to every family with some criteria, allowed
Families to import a used car to Tunisia. I want this chatbox to help them decide what to get with a certain budget and
other preferences and maybe even give them links to where they can see the car and the procedures to follow with details
on the pricing and papers they should prepare.
