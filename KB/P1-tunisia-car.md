### 🏠 Option E: Crédit Aménagement (Renovation Credit) — *The Tunisian Workaround*

#### ⚠️ Real Talk: How Tunisians Actually Use This

This is an **open secret** in Tunisia: Many people take a "Crédit Aménagement" (meant for home renovations) but use the
money to buy a car. Here's how it works:

1. Get a **devis (quote)** for home renovations from a contractor
2. Apply for Crédit Aménagement at the bank
3. Bank approves and deposits money
4. Use the money to buy a car instead 🚗

**Why do people do this?**

- Higher amounts than crédit personnel
- Longer repayment period (5 years vs 3)
- Sometimes better rates than crédit auto
- More flexible than leasing

#### Official Terms (Crédit Aménagement)

| Bank    | Max Amount   | Financing        | Duration | Rate        |
|---------|--------------|------------------|----------|-------------|
| UIB     | 35,000 TND   | 80% of work cost | 5 years  | Competitive |
| BTE     | 80% of works | 80%              | 5 years  | TMM-based   |
| BNA     | varies       | 80%              | varies   | TMM-based   |
| BH Bank | varies       | 80%              | 5 years  | Competitive |

#### Required Documents

- CIN (ID card)
- Proof of address
- **Devis des travaux** (quote for renovation work) ← *This is the key document*
- Last 3 pay slips
- Annual salary attestation

#### The Math: Why It Can Work for Cars

| Scenario      | Crédit Auto          | Crédit Aménagement            |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Amount needed | 40,000 TND           | 35,000 TND max                |
| Duration      | 5-7 years            | 5 years                       |
| Rate          | TMM + 3-4%           | TMM + 2-3% (sometimes)        |
| Justification | Car invoice required | Devis travaux (easier to get) |
| Down payment  | 20-30% required      | 20% (of "renovation")         |

#### ⚠️ Risks & Considerations

- **Technically misuse** of credit purpose
- Bank could theoretically ask for proof of work done
- In practice, banks rarely verify post-disbursement
- If caught, could affect future credit applications
- Chatbot should mention this option **neutrally** without explicitly encouraging misuse

### 💡 Chatbot Integration Ideas

The chatbot should:

1. Ask if user prefers cash, credit, or leasing
2. For credit: Check employment status, income
3. For leasing: Check if professional or business
4. Show monthly payment simulations
5. Compare total cost across options
6. Link to bank/leasing company simulators
7. **Mention crédit aménagement as an option** (tactfully)

### Chatbot Financing Decision Tree

```
"How will you finance your car?"
    │
    ├─ "I'll pay cash" → Show best car options for budget
    │
    └─ "I need financing" → "What's your situation?"
          │
          ├─ "I'm a salaried employee"
          │     │
          │     ├─ Need < 15,000 TND? → Crédit Personnel (fast, no justification)
          │     │
          │     ├─ Need 15,000-35,000 TND? 
          │     │     └─ "Do you own your home?"
          │     │           ├─ YES → Crédit Aménagement option available
          │     │           └─ NO → Crédit Auto
          │     │
          │     └─ Need > 35,000 TND? → Crédit Auto (longer term)
          │
          ├─ "I'm a professional/business owner"
          │     └─ Leasing (tax advantages, 100% financing)
          │
          └─ "I'm retired"
                └─ Crédit Personnel or Crédit Auto (pension-based)

## 4. Tax Calculations

### Standard Import Duties (Without FCR)

```
Base: CIF Value (Car + Shipping + Insurance)

Duties typically include:
- Customs duty: 10-43% (varies by origin)
- Consumption tax: 10-88% (based on engine)
- TVA: 19%
- Other fees: stamps, homologation

Total can reach: 150-250% of car value
```

### FCR Renouvelable Calculation

```
Franchise Totale (RS): 0 TND
Franchise Partielle: 
  - 25% × normal_duties (small engine)
  - 30% × normal_duties (large engine)
```

### "Une Voiture" Calculation

```
Consumption tax: 10% × CIF value
TVA: 7% × (CIF + consumption tax)
Total: ~17-18% vs ~200% normal
```
