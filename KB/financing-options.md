## Option E: Crédit Aménagement (Renovation Credit) — *The Tunisian Workaround*

### ⚠️ Real Talk: How Tunisians Actually Use This

This is an **open secret** in Tunisia: Many people take a "Crédit Aménagement" (meant for home renovations) but use the money to buy a car. Here's how it works:

1. Get a **devis (quote)** for home renovations from a contractor
2. Apply for Crédit Aménagement at the bank
3. Bank approves and deposits money
4. Use the money to buy a car instead 🚗

**Why do people do this?**

- Higher amounts than crédit personnel
- Longer repayment period (5 years vs 3)
- Sometimes better rates than crédit auto
- More flexible than leasing

### Official Terms (Crédit Aménagement)

| Bank    | Max Amount   | Financing        | Duration | Rate        |
|---------|--------------|------------------|----------|-------------|
| UIB     | 35,000 TND   | 80% of work cost | 5 years  | Competitive |
| BTE     | 80% of works | 80%              | 5 years  | TMM-based   |
| BNA     | varies       | 80%              | varies   | TMM-based   |
| BH Bank | varies       | 80%              | 5 years  | Competitive |

### Required Documents

- CIN (ID card)
- Proof of address
- **Devis des travaux** (quote for renovation work) ← *This is the key document*
- Last 3 pay slips
- Annual salary attestation

### The Math: Why It Can Work for Cars

| Scenario      | Crédit Auto          | Crédit Aménagement            |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Amount needed | 40,000 TND           | 35,000 TND max                |
| Duration      | 5-7 years            | 5 years                       |
| Rate          | TMM + 3-4%           | TMM + 2-3% (sometimes)        |
| Justification | Car invoice required | Devis travaux (easier to get) |
| Down payment  | 20-30% required      | 20% (of "renovation")         |

### ⚠️ Risks & Considerations

- **Technically misuse** of credit purpose
- Bank could theoretically ask for proof of work done
- In practice, banks rarely verify post-disbursement
- If caught, could affect future credit applications
- This option should be considered **neutrally** - understand the risks
