## 1. WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CAR BUYERS

While not directly related to FCR car imports, solar panel information is relevant because:

- **EV Charging**: Families considering electric/hybrid vehicles can charge at home
- **Budget Planning**: Understanding total household energy costs helps budget for car expenses
- **Fuel Cost Offset**: Solar savings can offset fuel costs for traditional vehicles
- **Tunisia has 300+ days of sunshine** - ideal for solar investment

2. **Submit application** to STEG for grid connection
3. **Technical inspection** by STEG
4. **Installation** by certified professional
5. **Raccordement** (connection) and meter installation
6. **Receive certificate** for PROSOL ELEC subsidy

### Legal Framework

- **Law n°2019-47**: Simplified self-production authorization
- **Autoconsommation**: Consume your own production first
- **Surplus sale**: Sell excess to STEG at preferential rates
- **Limit**: Can sell up to 30% of production to STEG

### Requirements for Declaration

- All grid-connected installations **MUST** be declared to STEG
- Even 100% self-consumption requires declaration
- Non-declared installations are **illegal** and lose subsidy rights

## 7. RELEVANCE FOR EV/HYBRID OWNERS

### Charging an Electric Vehicle at Home

If you import an electric car via FCR:

| Daily Driving | kWh Needed | Solar Capacity      |
|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| 30 km/day     | ~5 kWh     | 3 kWc sufficient    |
| 50 km/day     | ~8 kWh     | 4-5 kWc recommended |
| 100 km/day    | ~15 kWh    | 6-8 kWc needed      |

**Cost comparison**:

- Charging from STEG: ~0.15-0.30 TND/km
- Charging from solar: Nearly FREE after ROI
- Gasoline equivalent: ~0.20-0.25 TND/km

### Combined Investment Strategy

For families considering FCR import + solar:

1. Budget **15,000-25,000 TND** for 3-4 kWc system
2. Use STEG credit to spread cost over 7 years
3. Solar savings can help pay car-related costs
4. If choosing hybrid/EV: install larger system (5-6 kWc)

## 9. QUICK COST CALCULATOR

**For a typical Tunisian family home (100-150 m²):**

| Item                        | Cost (TND)              |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 3 kWc installation          | 12,000                  |
| ANME subsidy                | -500                    |
| STEG credit used            | -7,500                  |
| **Your upfront cost**       | **4,000**               |
| Monthly STEG credit payment | ~180 TND (7 years)      |
| Monthly electricity savings | ~150-200 TND            |
