### Key Fuel Cost Insights

- **Government Subsidized**: Tunisia subsidizes fuel - the real cost is ~3.029 TND/L for gasoline and ~2.634 TND/L for
  diesel (2025 budget estimates)
- **Regional Comparison**: Tunisian drivers pay MORE than Libya & Algeria, but LESS than European countries
- **World Ranking**: Tunisia ranks 7th in Africa and 30th globally for cheapest fuel prices
- **Fuel Quality Concern**: Many Tunisian drivers believe domestically refined diesel may contaminate injection systems,
  leading to more frequent part replacements

### Fuel Cost Considerations for Car Import

- **Diesel vs Petrol**: Diesel is ~14% cheaper per liter
- **Fuel Efficiency Matters**: Given fuel costs, recommend fuel-efficient cars (5-7L/100km)
- **Hybrid Consideration**: While hybrids are available (Toyota, Kia, Hyundai, BMW, Mercedes), the market is still
  undeveloped
- **Electric Vehicles**: Market nascent; only 5 brands offer EVs; limited charging infrastructure (TotalEnergies leading
  EV station deployment)
