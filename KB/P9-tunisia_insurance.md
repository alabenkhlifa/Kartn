| **Vehicle Age**      | High       | Newer = higher premiums                     |
| **Vehicle Value**    | High       | Base for Tous Risques calculation           |

2. ✅ Add low-risk second driver
3. ✅ Take advanced driving course
4. ✅ Consider telematics ("black box") policies
5. ✅ Compare quotes (use assurance.tn comparator)
6. ✅ Don't auto-renew blindly
7. ✅ Choose higher deductible (franchise)
8. ❌ Don't add young/new drivers
9. ❌ Don't underestimate mileage (voids claims)

### Insurance for Imported Cars - Key Considerations

    - Under-declaration = claim problems
    - Over-declaration = overpaying premium

2. **Spare Parts Availability**
    - Insurers may consider this
    - Common European brands = standard rates
    - Rare models = potentially higher or limited coverage

3. **Homologation**
    - Must have ATT certification
    - Required for insurance validity

4. **First-Time Registration**
    - Need valid customs clearance
    - Temporary circulation permit acceptable initially

## 10. Chatbot Integration

### Insurance Questions to Ask Users

```
1. "Do you already have a car insured in Tunisia?"
   → If YES: Check for multi-car discount
   → If NO: Explain process

2. "What type of vehicle are you importing/buying?"
   → Thermal / Hybrid / Electric
   → Different considerations apply

3. "How old is/will be the vehicle?"
   → <5 years: Recommend Tous Risques
   → 5-10 years: Recommend Dommages Collision
   → >10 years: RC + selected options

4. "What's your budget for insurance?"
   → Help match formula to budget

5. "Will you be financing the car?"
   → If YES: Vol + Incendie mandatory
```

### Chatbot Response Templates

**For FCR RS Plate Questions:**
> "Your RS plate vehicle can be insured normally in Tunisia. However, remember that only you, your spouse, or others in
> your presence can drive it. For parents/children/siblings to drive alone, you'll need authorization from customs (
> douane)."

**For EV Insurance:**
> "Electric vehicles can get standard insurance, but I recommend checking with MAGHREBIA who offers a special 'Voitures
> Écologiques' product. Make sure your policy explicitly covers the battery, as this is the most expensive component."

**For Price Estimates:**
> "Insurance in Tunisia typically costs 800-1,000 TND/year for comprehensive coverage. For a more accurate estimate
> based on your profile, I recommend using the comparator at assurance.tn or requesting quotes from GAT, STAR, or COMAR."

**For New Drivers:**
> "As a new driver, expect higher premiums initially. Build your bonus over time by driving safely. Consider advanced
> driving courses for potential discounts."

### Insurance Calculator Logic (Simplified)

```python
def estimate_insurance(vehicle_age, vehicle_value, coverage_type):
    base_rate = {
        "RC": 0.005,
        "Tiers+": 0.01,
        "Collision": 0.015,
        "Tous Risques": 0.025
    }

    # Age adjustment
    if vehicle_age > 10:
        coverage_type = "RC"  # Force basic
    elif vehicle_age > 5:
        max_coverage = "Collision"

    premium = vehicle_value * base_rate[coverage_type]

    # Minimum thresholds
    minimums = {"RC": 200, "Tiers+": 400, "Collision": 600, "Tous Risques": 800}
    premium = max(premium, minimums[coverage_type])

    return premium
```
